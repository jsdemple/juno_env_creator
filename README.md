# Jupyter Ipykernel and Conda Environment Creator

Use this interactive tool to create a new Conda environment and make it available in your Jupyter Notebooks/lab with one command. I made this because I found myself often needing to create a new Conda environment and make it available in Jupyter and got tired of looking up the same commands and options every time.

# Installation:
1. Install Jupyter and Anaconda if not already on your machine.
2. Add `./juno_env_creator` to your `/usr/local/bin`: `sudo cp ./juno_env_creator /usr/local/bin`
3. Ensure that the file is executable: `sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/juno_env_creator`
 
# How to use:
Execute `juno_env_creator` and complete the interactive prompts.
